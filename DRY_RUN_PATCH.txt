ColdWatch Extraction â€” Phase 1 Dry-Run Patch Plan

Goal: Describe mechanical file moves renaming into the future standalone ColdWatch repo without changing logic.

Proposed repo structure (new project):
- pyproject.toml
- src/coldwatch/
  - __init__.py
  - cli.py             (entrypoints: run, scan, analyze)
  - core.py            (event loop, registry, handlers)
  - scanner.py         (tree scan utilities)
  - db.py              (SQLite access, schema)
  - privacy.py         (redaction, safe defaults)
  - types.py           (typed DTOs)
- tests/
- examples/

Mechanical source mapping from current snapshot:
- accessibility-logger/accessibility_logger.py -> src/coldwatch/core.py (split into core/scanner/db)
- accessibility-logger/run_test.py -> examples/run_test.py (adapt imports, CLI)
- accessibility-logger/mock_app.py -> examples/mock_app.py
- accessibility-logger/analyze_data.py -> src/coldwatch/cli.py: analyze subcommand
- accessibility-logger/test-features.py -> Omit from ColdWatch (belongs to parent workspace); keep note in MIGRATION.md

Additional mechanical tasks (later in Phase 2):
- Create minimal CLI wiring in `cli.py` calling existing functions after splitting.
- Move schema creation from constructor to db.py module method.
- No behavior changes; only module boundaries and imports.

Not executed in Phase 1; documented for traceability.
