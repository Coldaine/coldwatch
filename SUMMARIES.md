ColdWatch Extraction â€” Phase 1 Summaries

- accessibility_logger.py: AT-SPI event and text-capture logger writing events and text snapshots to SQLite with deduplication and periodic rescans.
- run_test.py: End-to-end test harness running the logger and a GTK mock app in a single D-Bus session (xvfb) and verifying DB contents.
- mock_app.py: Minimal GTK3 application that mutates a TextView buffer to produce observable text changes for the logger.
- analyze_data.py: SQLite analysis utility printing summary stats, active apps, recent captures, and role breakdowns.
- test-features.py: Rust workspace feature-combination test runner (unrelated to the logger functionality but present in the same folder); retained verbatim to avoid selective edits in Phase 1.
