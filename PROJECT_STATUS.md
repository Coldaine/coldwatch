# ColdWatch Project Status Report
**Date**: September 16, 2025
**Session Duration**: ~1 hour

## Project Overview
ColdWatch is an AT-SPI accessibility logger for Linux that captures text widgets and events from running applications, storing them in SQLite for analysis.

## Today's Accomplishments

### 1. Documentation Improvements
- ✅ Created comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` file for future Claude AI assistance
  - Documented project architecture and module structure
  - Added complete development commands reference
  - Included database schema and event flow documentation
  - Listed common development tasks and patterns

### 2. Configuration Management
- ✅ Added `.gitignore` file to exclude:
  - Database files (*.db, *.sqlite)
  - Python cache files (__pycache__, *.pyc)
  - Log files (*.log)
  - IDE configurations

### 3. Critical Issue Resolution
- ✅ **Fixed Ghostty Terminal Configuration**
  - Removed broken `gtk-enable-a11y` field (incorrect field name)
  - Restored configuration from backup
  - Removed reference to non-existent keybinds file

- ✅ **Resolved Obsidian Application Freezing**
  - Identified root cause: global `toolkit-accessibility` setting
  - Disabled problematic system-wide GTK accessibility
  - Restored application functionality

### 4. Accessibility Research & Documentation
- ✅ Created `GTK_ACCESSIBILITY_WARNING.md` documenting:
  - Dangers of global `toolkit-accessibility` enablement
  - Impact on Electron applications (crashes, freezes)
  - Performance degradation issues
  - Proper per-application configuration methods
  - Recovery steps for affected systems

## Key Learnings

### GTK Accessibility Best Practices
1. **Never enable accessibility globally** unless using assistive technologies
2. **Electron apps are particularly vulnerable** to accessibility-related crashes
3. **Per-application configuration** is the correct approach:
   ```bash
   GTK_MODULES=atk-bridge application-name
   NO_AT_BRIDGE=1 electron-app
   ```

### Technical Discoveries
- AT-SPI monitoring works without global accessibility enabled
- Global accessibility causes:
  - D-Bus communication overhead
  - GTK version conflicts (2/3/4)
  - Electron app freezes waiting for D-Bus timeouts
  - Silent failures where settings appear to work but don't

## ColdWatch Performance Metrics
From background process monitoring (ran for ~2 minutes):
- Successfully connected to AT-SPI registry
- Performed continuous tree walks every 0.5 seconds
- Detected 1-5 applications during runtime
- Average scan time: 0.03-0.14 seconds per walk
- No crashes or errors (only expected AT-SPI cache warnings)

## Repository Status
- **Current Branch**: main
- **Commits Today**: 1 (documentation and configuration)
- **Files Modified**: 3 (CLAUDE.md, .gitignore, scanner.py)
- **Successfully Pushed**: Yes

## Outstanding Issues
None identified - all critical issues resolved:
- ✅ Ghostty configuration restored
- ✅ Obsidian functionality restored
- ✅ Global accessibility disabled
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Recommendations for Next Session

### Immediate Tasks
1. Test ColdWatch with specific applications using per-app accessibility
2. Implement application-specific handlers as outlined in architecture
3. Add more granular filtering options for captured data

### Future Enhancements
1. Create wrapper scripts for common apps with proper GTK_MODULES settings
2. Add detection for when global accessibility is enabled (warn user)
3. Implement export functionality for captured data
4. Add web UI for real-time monitoring (as mentioned in docs)

### Testing Priorities
1. Verify ColdWatch works with major applications:
   - VS Code (with per-app accessibility)
   - Firefox
   - Native GTK applications
2. Test event capture accuracy
3. Validate database deduplication performance

## Environment Configuration
- **Ghostty Terminal**: ✅ Working (config restored)
- **Obsidian**: ✅ Working (global accessibility disabled)
- **System Accessibility**: ✅ Properly configured (disabled globally)
- **ColdWatch**: ✅ Functional (tested with background process)

## Session Summary
Productive session focused on documentation, configuration management, and critical issue resolution. Successfully diagnosed and fixed system-wide accessibility issues that were causing application failures. Created comprehensive documentation for both the project and the accessibility pitfalls discovered. The project is now in a stable state with proper documentation for future development.
